# portal-puncher-sm

A dependency-less, IO-less implementation of the hole-punching protocol used by [`portal-tunneler`](https://github.com/ThomasMiz/portal-tunneler).

# THIS PROJECT IS IN BETA!

While the project has most of the main features implemented, some things are still missing and the project needs some cleanup and refactoring to pretty it up before release.

Additionally, this beta version makes no guarantees on stability, security nor compatibility with other versions.
